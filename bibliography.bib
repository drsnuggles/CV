  abstract = {For seagrasses, seasonal and daily variations in light and temperature
	represent the mains factors driving their distribution along the
	bathymetric cline. Changes in these environmental factors, due to
	climatic and anthropogenic effects, can compromise their survival.
	In a framework of conservation and restoration, it becomes crucial
	to improve our knowledge about the physiological plasticity of seagrass
	species along environmental gradients. Here, we aimed to identify
	differences in transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, involved in
	the acclimation along the depth gradient in the seagrass Posidonia
	oceanica, and to improve the available molecular resources in this
	species, which is an important requisite for the application of eco-genomic
	approaches. To do that, from plant growing in shallow (-5 m) and
	deep (-25 m) portions of a single meadow, (i) we generated two reciprocal
	Expressed Sequences Tags (EST) libraries using a Suppressive Subtractive
	Hybridization (SSH) approach, to obtain depth/specific transcriptional
	profiles, and (ii) we identified proteins differentially expressed,
	using the highly innovative USIS mass spectrometry methodology, coupled
	with 1D-SDS electrophoresis and labeling free approach. Mass spectra
	were searched in the open source Global Proteome Machine (GPM) engine
	against plant databases and with the X!Tandem algorithm against a
	local database. Transcriptional analysis showed both quantitative
	and qualitative differences between depths. EST libraries had only
	the 3\% of transcripts in common. A total of 315 peptides belonging
	to 64 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. ATP synthase
	subunits were among the most abundant proteins in both conditions.
	Both approaches identified genes and proteins in pathways related
	to energy metabolism, transport and genetic information processing,
	that appear to be the most involved in depth acclimation in P. oceanica.
	Their putative rules in acclimation to depth were discussed.},

  abstract = {How do chromosomal regions with differing degrees of homology and
	homeology interact at meiosis? We provide a novel analytical method
	based on simple genetics principles which can help to answer this
	important question. This method interrogates high-throughput molecular
	marker data in order to infer chromosome behavior at meiosis in interspecific
	hybrids. We validated this method using high-resolution molecular
	marker karyotyping in two experimental Brassica populations derived
	from interspecific crosses among B. juncea, B. napus and B. carinata,
	using a single nucleotide polymorphism chip. This method of analysis
	successfully identified meiotic interactions between chromosomes
	sharing different degrees of similarity: full-length homologs; full-length
	homeologs; large sections of primary homeologs; and small sections
	of secondary homeologs. This analytical method can be applied to
	any allopolyploid species or fertile interspecific hybrid in order
	to detect meiotic associations. This genetic information can then
	be used to identify which genomic regions share functional homeology
	(i.e., retain enough similarity to allow pairing and segregation
	at meiosis). When applied to interspecific hybrids for which reference
	genome sequences are available, the question of how differing degrees
	of homology and homeology affect meiotic interactions may finally
	be resolved.},
