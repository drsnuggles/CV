# About

My CV, based on Friggeri's style and CV: http://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv

I replaced the non-free font by Source Sans Pro, which you can get from here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcesans.adobe/

CV is probably not up-to-date.

# Requirements

biber for the citations, XeLaTeX for compiling, Source Sans Pro for the font.

There's a Fedora repository for biber at http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/mef/biber/.

XeLaTeX should work by installing the texlive distribution.


Original README:

# About
Latest version of my CV, typesetted in Helvetica and using colors inspired by Monokai (there is an `print` option which renders in black and white, and reverts the header to dark on light, if printing on paper is needed).

Uses TikZ for the header, XeTeX and fontspec to use Helvetica Neue, biblatex to print my publications and textpos for the aside.
